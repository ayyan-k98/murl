"""
Improved Configuration

Based on performance diagnosis and proven RL best practices.

Key improvements:
1. Slower epsilon decay (better exploration)
2. Smaller network (faster, easier to learn)
3. Larger replay buffer (more diverse experiences)
4. Better learning rate schedule
5. Improved curriculum (easier start)
