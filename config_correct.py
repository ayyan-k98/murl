"""
CORRECT Optimized Configuration

Based on deep analysis of actual problem:
- Main issue: Epsilon decay too fast (hits floor at ep 130)
- Secondary issue: Weak reward signal
- Tertiary issue: Short n-step horizon

KEY INSIGHT: Episode length MUST stay at 350!
- Grid: 20√ó20 = 400 cells
- 350 steps = 87.5% max coverage (if perfect)
- 250 steps = 62.5% max coverage (too limiting!)

Optimizations focus on:
1. LEARNING QUALITY (not speed!)
2. Proper exploration budget
3. Stronger reward signals
4. Better credit assignment
5. Minor speed improvements where safe
