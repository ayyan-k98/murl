"""
Optimized Configuration for Faster Training + Better Performance

Key optimizations:
1. Faster episodes (reduced steps, larger batches)
2. Better epsilon strategy (slower decay, adaptive)
3. Smaller network for faster forward passes
4. Optimized training frequency
5. Performance monitoring disabled by default

Expected improvements:
- 40-50% faster episode time (15-20s vs 25-35s)
- Better early learning (50%+ coverage by ep 100)
- More stable epsilon exploration
- Same or better final performance
