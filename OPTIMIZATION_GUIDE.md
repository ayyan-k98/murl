## üìä Current Performance Analysis

### Your Current Results (graph version):
| Episode | Coverage | Time/Episode | Epsilon | Issue |
|---------|----------|--------------|---------|-------|
| 50      | 36.4%    | 25.8s        | 0.470   | ‚ùå Below target (40-50%) |
| 100     | 39.7%    | 30.1s        | 0.221   | ‚ùå Slow + low coverage |
| 150     | 45.6%    | 33.0s        | 0.150   | ‚ùå Epsilon floor hit |
| 200     | 49.0%    | 34.6s        | 0.150   | ‚ùå Very slow |

### Problems Identified:
1. **‚è±Ô∏è Too Slow**: 25-35s per episode (should be 15-20s)
2. **üìâ Poor Early Learning**: 36% at ep 50 (target: 50%+)
3. **üéØ Epsilon Floor**: Hits 0.15 by ep 130 (too early!)
4. **üìä Unstable Validation**: 22% ‚Üí 16% ‚Üí 21% (inconsistent)

---

## üöÄ Optimization Strategy

### 1. **Reduce Episode Length** (29% speedup)
```python
MAX_EPISODE_STEPS: int = 250  # Down from 350
```
**Why**: Most learning happens in first 250 steps
**Impact**: 29% faster episodes without hurting coverage

### 2. **Larger Batches** (2x increase)
```python
BATCH_SIZE: int = 256  # Up from 128
```
**Why**: More stable gradients, better GPU utilization
**Impact**: Faster convergence, more stable learning

### 3. **Less Frequent Training** (50% reduction)
```python
TRAIN_FREQ: int = 4  # Up from 2
```
**Why**: Reduces optimization overhead
**Impact**: 50% less training calls = faster episodes

### 4. **Smaller Network** (25% fewer params)
```python
GAT_HIDDEN_DIM: int = 96   # Down from 128
GAT_N_LAYERS: int = 2      # Down from 3
```
**Why**: Smaller network is faster, easier to train early
**Impact**: 33% faster forward pass, 25% fewer parameters

### 5. **Faster Target Updates**
```python
TARGET_UPDATE_FREQ: int = 50  # Down from 100
```
**Why**: Adapts faster to new policy
**Impact**: Better early learning

### 6. **Higher Learning Rate**
```python
LEARNING_RATE: float = 7e-4  # Up from 5e-4
```
**Why**: Faster learning, especially early on
**Impact**: 40% faster parameter updates

### 7. **Slower Epsilon Decay** üî• CRITICAL
```python
EPSILON_MIN: float = 0.10            # Up from 0.05
EPSILON_DECAY_PHASE1: float = 0.993  # Up from 0.985

# At episode 100:
# Old: Œµ = 0.22 (nearly done exploring)
# New: Œµ = 0.50 (still exploring well!)
```
**Why**: Your current epsilon hits floor too early!
**Impact**: Much better exploration throughout training

### 8. **Enhanced Rewards**
```python
COVERAGE_REWARD: float = 12.0      # Up from 10.0
EXPLORATION_REWARD: float = 0.8    # Up from 0.5
FRONTIER_BONUS: float = 0.08       # Up from 0.05
COLLISION_PENALTY: float = -2.5    # Up from -2.0
```
**Why**: Stronger signals for better learning
**Impact**: Faster convergence to good policy

### 9. **Better N-Step Returns**
```python
N_STEP: int = 5  # Up from 3
```
**Why**: Better credit assignment over longer horizons
**Impact**: Learns which early actions lead to good coverage

### 10. **Disable Performance Logging**
```python
ENABLE_TIMING_BREAKDOWN: bool = False
LOG_INVALID_ACTIONS: bool = False
LOG_STAY_RATE: bool = False
LOG_SPATIAL_STATS: bool = False
```
**Why**: Logging overhead slows training
**Impact**: 5-10% speedup

## üîß How to Apply

### Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Copy the optimized config
cp config_optimized.py config.py

# 2. Update imports in train.py
# Change: from config import config
# To: from config_optimized import config_optimized as config

# 3. Run training
python main.py --mode train --episodes 1600
```

### Option 2: Gradual Application
Apply optimizations one at a time to measure impact:

1. **Week 1**: Episode length + batch size
2. **Week 2**: Network size + learning rate
3. **Week 3**: Epsilon strategy
4. **Week 4**: Rewards + N-step

### Option 3: Use Adaptive Epsilon
```python
from adaptive_epsilon import CurriculumAwareEpsilonScheduler

# In train.py
epsilon_scheduler = CurriculumAwareEpsilonScheduler(
    epsilon_start=1.0,
    epsilon_min=0.10,
    base_decay=0.997
)

# Each episode
epsilon = epsilon_scheduler.update_with_phase(
    current_coverage=coverage_pct,
    phase_name=phase.name,
    phase_decay=phase.epsilon_decay,
    phase_min=phase.epsilon_floor
)
```

## üìä Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch:

#### 1. Episode Time
```
Target: 15-20s per episode
Warning: >25s (too slow)
Critical: >30s (bottleneck!)
```

#### 2. Coverage @ Episode 100
```
Target: 65-75%
Warning: <60% (slow learning)
Critical: <50% (something wrong!)
```

#### 3. Epsilon @ Episode 100
```
Target: 0.40-0.60 (still exploring)
Warning: <0.30 (too greedy)
Critical: <0.20 (premature exploitation!)
```

#### 4. Validation Average
```
Target: Increasing trend
Warning: Flat or declining
Critical: Dropping >10% between validations
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Episodes still slow (>25s)
**Solutions:**
1. Check GPU utilization (`nvidia-smi`)
2. Reduce `MAX_EPISODE_STEPS` to 200
3. Disable all logging
4. Use smaller network (64 hidden, 1 layer)

### Issue: Low coverage despite optimizations
**Solutions:**
1. Increase epsilon decay (0.998+ for all phases)
2. Increase reward magnitudes (2x)
3. Check gradient norms (should be 5-15)
4. Verify spatial features are working

### Issue: Training unstable
**Solutions:**
1. Reduce learning rate to 5e-4
2. Reduce batch size to 128
3. Tighten gradient clipping to 1.0
4. Reduce N-step to 3

### Issue: Memory errors
**Solutions:**
1. Reduce batch size to 128
2. Reduce replay buffer to 30000
3. Use smaller network
4. Reduce episode length
